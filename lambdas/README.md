# java-lambdas

Java lambda examples, these modules provide the necessary knowledge to the programmer to manage the principles of functional programming using lambda expressions and method references, with special emphasis on the use of static and default methods at the interface level.

Lambda comes from the Lambda Calculus and refers to anonymous functions in programming.

Lambda expressions can only be used to implement functional interfaces, which are interfaces having a single abstract method. An interface with two abstract methods can't be implemented by a lambda expression.

A lambda expression allows you to write quick throw away functions without naming them. It also provides a nice way to write closures.
